## *About Timewise*
College students often face difficulties when it comes to creating a balanced 
course schedule that not only adhere to university requirements but also
satisfy personal preferences -- all due to a variety of reasons: 
- You're not sure what classes you want to take 
- Data about classes, professors, etc are not centralized
- Advisors are too busy to give a timely or detailed response, especially during
drop/add week.

While there are other solutions that attempt to tackle this challenge, none 
of them provide a satisfactory solution -- nor do they take harness the power of
newer technologies like AI to create a more streamlined process and provide
enough features. __*Timewise is the solution.*__
